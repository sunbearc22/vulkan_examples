# Background
Here is a collection of codes on how to use [python3](https://docs.python.org/3/),  [vulkan](https://github.com/realitix/vulkan) (an excellent python wrapper developed by realitix to Khronos's [Vulkan API](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/))  and [py-sdl2](https://github.com/marcusva/py-sdl2) (a python ctype wrapper to SDL2 developed by marcusva) to accomplish the same C++ Vulkan tutorials excellently prepared by and shared by Alexander Overvoorde at [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction).

The Vulkan API is powerful and customizable, but it is multifaceted, complex and non-trivial. As such, I hope this sharing can help in some ways sooth the steep learning curve involved with learning-using the Vulkan API. I write these example codes as I learn them. For well written vulkan example, I strongly recommend studying the python scripts shared by realitix (see vulkan).

# vulkan_examples
1. Hello Triangle
   - base example
   - v2 revisions made to allow DebugCallBacks
   - v3 revisions made to allow resizable window (requires Swapchain Recreation).
